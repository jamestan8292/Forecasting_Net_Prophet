# Forecasting_Net_Prophet

In this analysis, an e-commerce site, [MercadoLibre](https://https://investor.mercadolibre.com/investor-relations)'s financial and search traffic are examined to identify unusual search trends, seasonality of search traffic, and the search traffic in relation to its stock price. Also, Facebook Prophet is used to forecast the revenue of the site.

There are five steps in this analysis, as follows:

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

* Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

* Step 5 : Forecast revenue by using time series models
